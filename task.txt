Document object in javascript:
      
            1. It is an object of the browser. Each HTML document loaded into a browser window becomes a Document object.
               The Document object provides access to all HTML elements in a page from within a script.
            2. It is also part of the window object and can be accessed through the window document property.
            3. Using document object :
                    For Example:
                            a.number of anchors also we can display, number of buttons we can display, 
                              number of images we can display and the number of forms we can display.

                              <head>

                                    <script type = "text/javascript">
                                    document.write(document.title);
                                 </body>

               and DOM(document object model).

Window object in javascript:

            1. It is an object of a window. The window object represents an open window in a browser.
               If a document contains frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document,
              and one additional window object for each frame.
            2. The window object is created automatically by the browser that represents a window of a browser.
               the window object is used to display the popup dialog box.
                        Methods:
                              a.alret()
                              b.confirm()
                              c.open()
                              d.prompt()
                              e.open()
                              f.close()
                              g.setTimeout() 

            3. Create a window in javascript for example:
                               <html>
                                 <script>
                                    function openWindow() {
                                    window.open("", "", "width=300,height=200");
                                    }
                               </script>
                                <body>
                                    <b> Click the button to open a new window in the same tab </b>
                                </body>
                               </html>       

            4. It contains information about the browser window like the size, the document, 
               the window contains, and the Windows history.
            5. We can access the window from the window only. The window is part of BOM, not DOM. 
               Global objects functions and variables of javascript are members of the window object
